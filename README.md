# Nyx Framework and Plugins

Nyx is a fast network messaging system develop to bridge DCC's. There are multiple plugins develop for different tasks, but mostly related to 3dsmax centric.

Almost everything in the Nyx system is plugable, from message actions, messaging filtering and internal services. Internally it uses Rx and NetMQ.

# Open source
We are going to open source every plugin we develop for the Nyx framework, like Nyx Voltron (3dsmax<->After Effects), Nyx DBR (3dsmax generic distributed render) and Nyx Sidekick (3dsmax<->Houdini). But this release will happen slowly since there is a lot of code review that needs to happen.
