# Nyx Framework and Plugins

Nyx is a fast network messaging system develop to bridge DCC's. There are multiple plugins develop for different tasks, but mostly related to 3dsmax centric.

Nyx Voltron provides a very powerful and efficient workflow between 3ds Max and Adobe After Effects with interactive capabilities.
Link anything from 3ds Max to AE with as little baking as possible and preserving Bezier keys/handles on animation curves.
Feel from to join our Nyx Facebook group to hang out, get updates, make feature request, report bugs, etc!
